<p>&#8230;there was a <strong>mouse</strong> called Rudolf who was a very bad mouse.</p>
<p>One day, Lucy, Rudolf´s <strong>neighbour</strong> came back from shopping and needed help carrying her bags full of food, so she asked him:</p>

<p>&#8211; &#8220;Hi Rudolf, Can you help me to carry these bags, please?&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8220;No!&#8221; &#8211; Rudolf replied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The little mouse girl started crying. Just at that moment, a handsome young mouse, called Richard, was walking along the street. He saw the little mouse girl crying and felt sorry for her.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8220;Let me help you&#8221; &#8211; he said.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8220;Thank you so much! &#8211; Lucy said.</p>
<p>Rudolf was <span style=""color: #993300;""><strong>jealous</strong></span>, even though he didn´t want to help her in that moment.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8220;That mouse shouldn´t be near Lucy, she only asks me for help&#8221;, he said.</p>
<p>Jealousy made Rudolf behave differently.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8220;Richard, don&#8217;t, I will <strong>help</strong> her&#8221; &#8211; Rudolf said.</p>
<p>Richard exclaimed surprised &#8211; &#8220;As you prefer!&#8221;</p>
<p>And from then on Rudolf helped Lucy any time she needed it. Lucy talked to him, and advised him not to be so mean, because he had to <span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>learn to behave correctly</strong></span>, especially when somebody offered help.</p>
<p>She also told him that jealousy was bad and could give rise to many problems. Rudolf realized that his attitude was not good at all, and started to change.</p>
<p>Years passed and Lucy and Rudolf fell in <span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>love</strong></span>, got married and lived happily ever after.</p>
<p>In addition, they became very good friends to Richard, who was a very <strong>kind</strong> mouse.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #ff00ff;""><em><strong>And that is the end of the story&#8230;</strong></em></span></p>
<p><em><strong>Moral of the Short Story for Kids:</strong> Don&#8217;t be rude to the others, be kind and help who ever needs it, this way you will be happier.</em></p>
